# Setup
First, you need to set up 2 things:
## 1. MySQL server üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Details [here](https://realpython.com/python-mysql/#installing-mysql-server).  
While installing MySQL server, you will need to enter a password for the `root` (admin) account.  
This way you will get the `USER` and `PASSWORD` needed for the `credentials.py` file.
## 2. MySQL connector
Meaning a Python library. Install in shell:
```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
```
And then check if this runs without errors:
```python
import mysql.connector
```
